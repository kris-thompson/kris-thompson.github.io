<p>Hi! My name is Kris Thompson, thank you for taking the time to view my site. Here I will give you a bit of background on myself and what I'm currently up to.</p>
</br>
<h2>Skills and Education</h2>
<p>	I graduated from the University of Iowa in May of 2014 with a Bachelors in Informatics. During my time
in college I used various different programming languages such as Java, SQL, and HTML to name a couple. 
After I graduated i started working at Wellmart in a temp position with their security administration team.
There my job consisted of providing access to new and existed employees to various systems and fileshares using
Microsoft CRM, Active directory, and Oracle Analytics tools.
</br>	
	After the temp job ended I found a job in collections with Wells Fargo for a year, and during my time there developed
a toolbar for the collections system that was being used at the time. The toolbar helped with login times for the 6 different
systems of the application and allowed users to click a button to be taken to different screens of the app in addition to
displaying information about the specific screen in a tooltip. The application used Visual Basic for making toolbars and 
is a language I learned pieces of as needed while in the process of developing. After showing the toolbar to a manager I
got the go ahead to install it for everyone in the department who wanted it.
</br>
	I left Wells Fargo for an opportunity at Ken Garff Automotive as an IT analyst. In this role i was responsible for 
the software and hardware needs of 5 dealerships that Ken Garff owned in the Des Moines area including the Stew Hansen's
in Clive and Dewey Ford/Dodge in Ankeny. I was one of only 2 IT employees in the state and worked through an email ticketing
system and was responsible for closing 100+ tickets a month on average. Typical tickets involved software/hardware troubleshooting,
fixing or replacing full PC's, and wiring new connections to switches in the server room for cameras, access points, new desks, etc.
</br>	    
	I left Ken Garff for an opportunity at EMC Insurance. I made this decision because I wanted to use my educational background in
programming and was offered a position at EMC as an Application Developer. In this new role my first 2 months were spend in a 
self paced learning class to learn Mapper which is an older Unisys product that is still in use there. I quickly finished the course
and was placed on a team supporting the personal lines systems that EMC agents and other departments use for managing policies.
EMC had started to switch to Agile methodologies so my first couple of sprints i was working using paired programming with a senior
developer so i could start to learn the systems and after was choosing my own work in the planning sessions and asking for advice when 
needed.
</p>
</br>
<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
<p>Outside of work and school I enjoy several different activities. During the warmer months I frequently go on 
trails throughout the city on a bike or skates and recently I've taken up skiing and snowboarding.
 Occasionally I also do some woodworking when I have the tools available, and when I have time at home I generally 
will be playing video games or working on some programming projects which I will be adding information about on this site 
as they become more developed.</p>
