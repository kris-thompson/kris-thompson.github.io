<p>Hi! My name is Kris Thompson, thank you for taking the time to view my site. Here I will give you a bit of background on myself and what I'm currently up to.</p>
</br>
<h2>Skills and Education</h2>
<p>I graduated from the University of Iowa in May of 2014 with a Bachelors in Informatics. During my time
in college I used various different programming languages such as Java, SQL, and HTML to name a couple. 
I was also working in retail at Target while going through college and have years of customer service experience as well as 
experience working in team-based/solo environments and working with deadlines from my time there. I also have experience with 
computer hardware from making custom PCs on my own time.</p>
</br>
<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
<p>Outside of work and school I enjoy several different activities. During the warmer months I frequently go on 
trails throughout the city on a bike or skates and recently I've taken up skiing and snowboarding.
 Occasionally I also do some woodworking when I have the tools available, and when I have time at home I generally 
will be playing video games or working on some programming projects which I will be adding information about on this site 
as they become more developed.</p>
